# Direct Image Links in Girlsreleased.com

Links to images in sets on Girlsreleased.com usually lead to imx.to, an image host which tends to go overboard with ad redirects, often to sites of questionable reputation and attempts to get you to install malware on your PC. This script for Tampermonkey/Greasemonkey/Violentmonkey and similar browser add-ons enables to change the links to the actual image servers imx.to uses.

## Installation

To use this script you have to have the Tampermonkey, Greasemonkey OR Violentmonkey browser add-on installed.
Click on the gr-imxto.user.js and select the "Raw" view. Your browser-add on should now automatically offer you to install this script.

## Usage

When Girlsreleased presents you with the thumbnails in a set, try the server options and press the button. The background color of the Thumbnails should change. Try all server options until the link leads you to the desired picture.
